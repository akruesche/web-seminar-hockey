            <h3>Hockey!</h3>
            <img src="assets/hockey-header.jpg">
            <p>I have watched hockey since before I can remember and played since I was four.<br>
                I skate out in roller hockey and play goalie in ice.
            </p>

            <h3>Gaming!</h3>
            <img src="assets/gaming.jpg">
            <p>My first games were Blades of Steel (surprise...its a hockey game) and Super Mario Bros. on the NES. <br>
                Didn't really understand how to play games until the SNES when Donkey Kong Country became my go to game and the first game I ever completed. <br>
                I own nearly every system from the NES on (missing Sega consoles and a few others) but I am all about the PC now.

            <p>Are these in the right order? <br>
                I think my wife would argue no... <br>
                And I agree, because happy wife, happy life (so they say...).
